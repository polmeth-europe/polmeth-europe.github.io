<p itemprop="description">The PolMeth Europe takes place on 19-20 June 2023 at King's College London. It brings together junior and senior scholars interested in innovative research methods and their applications. The conference follows the well-established PolMeth format: Faculty and postdocs have the opportunity to present papers and receive in-depth feedback. PhD students present their research in poster format, with abundant opportunity for input from more senior colleagues. The conference will be held as an in-person event. After two successful events with in online and hybrid mode we will finally all meet in person in London. We want to enable in-person networking among data-driven political scientists on the old continent to strengthen the community of like-minded scholars.</p>
