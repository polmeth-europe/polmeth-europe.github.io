Please submit your abstract and join us in London in June 2023 for the 3rd PolMeth
Europe meeting.
</p>
<p>
For the first time, the PolMeth Europe Conference will be held in person. 
</p>
<p>
PolMeth Europe brings together junior and senior scholars interested in innovative research methods and their applications. The conference follows the well-established PolMeth format: Faculty and postdocs have the opportunity to present papers and receive in-depth feedback. PhD students present their research in poster format, with abundant opportunity for input from more senior colleagues. We welcome proposals that focus on methodological innovations as well as work that applies cutting-edge empirical methods to substantive questions from all subfields. We particularly encourage submissions that reflect the diversity of the profession in terms of backgrounds, experiences, and identities. Please submit your paper and poster proposals including a title and an extended abstract (max. 500 words) until February 28th 2023 using the following <a href="https://forms.office.com/e/z6zmPVXDkW">form</a>. 
</p>
